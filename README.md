# Project Description

The project My-Reads is an app that lets users organize the books according to categories like "currently reading", "want to read" and "read".
There is a link "Add New Books" on top of the home page. Clicking this redirects users to a search page. 
The search page lets users search the books according to their interests. Users just have to type the search query in the input box provided. The search result will appear with a variety of books.
The round menu button on the bottom right corner of each book thumbnail lets users select the shelf to move the book to.
If the book that appears on the search page is already on your shelf then that shelf name appears disabled if users click on the menu button. If a book is not on any of the shelves, none of the shelves' names appear disabled. The user is free to move the book to the shelf of his choice using this menu button. The change in the selection of shelves on the search page reflects the changes on the main page.

### `Clone the project`

You can run the command, "git clone https://github.com/deepeshpakhare/My-Reads.git" to clone the repository to your local machine.

### `npm install`

You can run this command in the project's root directory to download the dependencies of the project to run the cloned project on your local machine.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
